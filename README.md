# Questions

1. What are you proud of?
I restarted my Credit Check with Classes program four times after repeated failures and with each version
I began to see my code getting better and my understanding of it became clearer as well.

1. What do you need to improve?
I need to sit myself down and focus on the design of my programs before I begin writing them instead of jumping into them without understanding each individual piece. When I started listing out all of my data input/output and listed my methods and really separated each individual issue before writing my program, I started to approach my code with greater clarity and it made a huge difference. I also need to build my projects out of working on the ruby exercises. I had a difficult time with organizing my priorities and put myself in a weaker position because I was emphasizing my project over spending adequate time working through the ruby exercises.

# Rubric

## Functionality

Notes:

- [2] Student completes through Iteration 3

## Mechanics

Notes:

The student(s):

- [3] appropriately uses Strings, Integers, Floats, Ranges, Symbols, Nils, Arrays, and Hashes
- [3] implements best-choice enumerable methods to iterate over collections
- [2] uses boolean expressions and flow control structures to logically manage a program's flow
- [3] uses methods, arguments, and return values to break code into logical components
- [2] creates Classes that utilize instance variables, attribute accessors, and instance methods

## Design

Notes:

The student(s):

- [3] adheres to the Single Responsibility and DRY principles
- [3] creates Objects and Classes that appropriately encompass state and behavior
- [3] uses instance and local variables appropriately
- [3] writes readable code with the following characteristics:
    * Variable and method names are self explanatory
    * Methods are under 7 lines
    * Lines of code are under 80 characters
    * Project directory structure adheres to convention
    * A linter reports less than 5 errors

## Testing

Notes:

The student(s):

- [1] writes Minitest tests that describe the expected behavior of a program according to technical specifications
- [1] names and orders tests so that a test file reads like documentation
- [1] writes Minitest assertions that accurately test a piece of functionality
- [1] writes a test before writing code that implements the behavior to make that test pass
- [1] writes both integration and unit tests

## Version Control

Notes:

The student(s):

- [3] hosts their code on the master branch of their remote repository
- [3] makes commits in small chunks of functionality
- [3] submits and merges Pull Requests using the Github interface
